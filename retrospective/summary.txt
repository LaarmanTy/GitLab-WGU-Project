For the merge conflict created in part E I edited the branch. I used nano to add the version to the readme file
to make it merge correctly. 

For part C I made three changes.
1. I fixed the errors in the team file.
2. I corrected the closing tag in the services file.
3. I fixed the spelling error in the about us file.
